<h1>Low and Slow</h1>
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <b>sous vide</b>. 
In sous vide cooking, <dfn>you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) 
into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to</dfn>. 
In his book,<cite> Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q><i> ultra-low-temperature poaching</i></q>.</p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. 
To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time> November 30</time>.</p>
